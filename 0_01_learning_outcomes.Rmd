## Collecting and using data

-   Construct simple summaries of numeric variables in R using the `mean`, and `sd` functions.


## Statistical Concepts

-   Explain what sampling error is (in non-technical terms) and understand why it is necessary to quantify sampling error alongside point estimates.

-   Recognise the difference between the distribution of a sample, and the sampling distribution of an estimate derived from that sample.

-   Recognise the difference between the standard deviation (a property of a sample) and the standard error (a property of a sampling distribution).

-   Given a description of an experimental setting, recognise...

    1. ...the difference between a statistical population and a sample from the population.
    2. ...the difference between a population parameter and a point estimate of the population parameter.

-   Understand what is meant by the term 'null hypothesis' and, given a scenario, state the appropriate null hypothesis for the associated statistical test.

-   Identify whether or not a result is 'statistically significant' by examining the *p*-value it produces. 

-   Calculate the standard error of a sample mean when the population distribution of a variable follows a normal distribution.


## Simple parametric statistics 

-   Understand that a one-sample *t*-test is used to assess whether a population mean is different from a particular reference value (often 0).

-   Understand that a two-sample *t*-test is used to assess whether two population means are different from one another. 

-   Given an experimental scenario and question, choose the correct *t*-test to use to answer the question.

-   State the assumptions of the one-sample, and two-sample *t*-tests, and explain how you might check them for a given problem using R.

-   Carry out a one-sample or two-sample *t*-test using the `t.test` function, and be able to interpret the output produced by `t.test`.

-   Write an informative and concise summary of the results from a correlation analysis.


## Regression and ANOVA

-   Understand what simple linear regression and one-way ANOVA do, and when to use them.

-   Distinguish between situations in which correlation or regression is the most appropriate technique to use.

-   Fit a simple linear regression using the `lm` function and interpret the output from...

    1. ...`anova` to determine the significance of fit
    2. ...`summary` to extract the variance explained ($R^{2}$) and the fitted coefficients (intercept and slope) 

-   Calculate predicted $y$-values from a fitted regression.

-   Fit a one-way ANOVA using the `lm` function and interpret the global test of significance produced by the `anova` function.

-   Write an informative and concise summary of the results from a simple linear regression and one-way ANOVA analyses.


## Doing more with models

-   State the assumptions of the simple linear regression and one-way ANOVA models.

-   Use regression diagnostic plots to identify potential problems with the assumptions of a model.

-   Use the `plot` function with a fitted model object to...

    1. ...construct a residuals vs. fitted values plot and evaluate the linearity assumption (regression only).
    2. ...construct a normal probability plot and evaluate the normality assumption.
    3. ...construct a scale-location plot and evaluate the constant variance assumption.

-   When a problem with the assumptions of a model has been identified, choose an appropriate mathematical transformation to remedy the problem from...

    1. ...logarithm (including the "add 1" case when zeros are present)
    2. ...square root
    3. ...arcsine square root
    
-   Identify situations where transforming a variable fails, so that a non-parametric test is required.

-   Determine whether it is appropriate to carry out a multiple comparison test.

-   Where appropriate, carry out a Tukey multiple comparison test using the `TukeyHSD` or `HSD.test` functions and interpret the results.


## Experimental design

-   Understand that a paired-sample *t*-test is used to assess whether the mean difference among paired cases is different from reference value (usually 0). 

-   Given an experimental scenario and question, choose the correct *t*-test to use to answer the question.

-   State the assumptions of the paired-sample *t*-tests, and explain how you might check them for a given problem using R.

-   Carry out a paired-sample *t*-test using the `t.test` function, and be able to interpret the output produced by `t.test`.

-   Write an informative and concise summary of the results from a paired-sample *t*-test.


## Beyond simple models

-   Understand what two-way ANOVA and ANCOVA do and when to use them.

-   Understand what is meant by the terms 'main effect' and 'interaction' and evaluate the likely presence or absence of these effects using an interaction plot.

-   State the assumptions of the two-way ANOVA and ANCOVA models.

-   Fit a two-way ANOVA and ANCOVA using the `lm` function and interpret the three global tests of significance produced by the `anova` function.

-   Use the `plot` function with a fitted model object to...

    1. ...construct a residuals vs. fitted values plot and evaluate the linearity assumption (ANCOVA only).
    2. ...construct a normal probability plot and evaluate the normality assumption.
    3. ...construct a scale-location plot and evaluate the constant variance assumption.

-   Identify the main effect and interaction terms for which it is appropriate to carry out a multiple comparisons test.

-   Where appropriate, carry out Tukey multiple comparison test(s) using the `TukeyHSD` or `HSD.test` functions, and interpret the results.

-   Write an informative and concise summary of the results from a two-way ANOVA and ANCOVA analyses.


## Frequency data and non-parameteric tests

-   Recognise situations where you are studying one or more categorical variables and you need to compare the frequencies of each category (or combinations of categories) in some way.

-   Given an experimental scenario and question...

    1. ...decide on the appropriate type of analysis to use: goodness-of-fit, or contingency table.
    2. ...state the null hypothesis of the required test.
    
-   State the assumptions of the goodness-of-fit and contingency table tests.

-   Carry out a goodness-of-fit test using the `chisq.test` function.
